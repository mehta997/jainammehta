                India-based CA firm · Financial compliance platform
              </p>
              <p>
                Built an end-to-end GST automation platform for an India-based
                Chartered Accountant firm to generate GST files as per the
                latest government rules. The system automated data ingestion,
                validation, reconciliation, and GST return generation (GSTR
                formats), significantly reducing manual effort and errors.
                Implemented rule-based validations to adapt to frequent GST
                regulation updates and provided dashboards for CAs to manage
                multiple clients efficiently.
